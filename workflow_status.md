# DatasetForge Workflow Management Implementation Status

## Current Progress

I've completed Phase 2 of the server-side workflow management implementation:

1. ✅ Updated `apiClient.js` with all required workflow API endpoints
2. ✅ Created `WorkflowSelector` component with pagination, delete, and duplicate functionality
3. ✅ Created `WorkflowSelectionModal` component for choosing workflows
4. ✅ Updated `WorkflowEditor.jsx` with API integration and data transformation
5. ✅ Created utility functions in `workflowTransform.js` for converting between API and React Flow formats
6. ✅ Updated `WorkflowManager.jsx` to use the API instead of localStorage
7. ✅ Updated `Generate.jsx` to use the workflow API

## Implemented Features in Generate.jsx

1. ✅ Added state variables for workflow list, loading state, and selected workflow ID
2. ✅ Added functions to fetch workflows and load a specific workflow
3. ✅ Removed localStorage-related workflow code
4. ✅ Updated the `handleToggleWorkflow` function
5. ✅ Added workflow selection UI showing workflow details and buttons to select/manage
6. ✅ Integrated `WorkflowSelectionModal` for browsing and creating workflows
7. ✅ Updated workflow modal rendering logic to handle both selection and editing
8. ✅ Added proper loading and error state handling throughout the component

## Next Steps

1. Test all the workflow management functionality:
   - Test loading workflows list
   - Test selecting a workflow
   - Test creating and saving new workflow
   - Test updating existing workflow
   - Test workflow deletion and duplication
   - Test workflow data loading in Generate component

2. Update the Phase 3 tasks in `workflow_todo.md` for any remaining cleanup and polish

3. Make a commit with all the changes to complete Phase 2

## Summary of Implementation

The workflow management system now uses the backend API for all operations:
- Workflows are stored in the database instead of localStorage
- The UI components work with the server-side data
- Proper error handling and loading states are implemented
- The workflow execution logic remains largely the same, but uses data from the API

This implementation follows the single-user, local-first design of DatasetForge while providing a more reliable and persistent storage solution for workflows.
