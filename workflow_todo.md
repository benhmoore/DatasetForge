    -   [x] Add validation and error handling
-   [x] Update `Generate.jsx`
    -   [x] Add workflow fetching and selection
    -   [x] Implement workflow toggle functionality
    -   [x] Handle loading and error states

### Test Frontend Integration

ASK developer to complete these tasks and check them off:
